# Imagine being a bot \#6010
## By IzonitWasTaken

- Simple bot, nothing too much. Just a couple of commands that can be seen in the `src/index.js` file.

`TODO:`
1. Implement a command + event handler to make the bot easier to maintatin
2. Add more commands and fix the `/say` command
3. Finish with the in-dev stage of the bot and go on with in-prod version (uhh)

`P. S.:` Does anyone even read the `LICENSE` file?
